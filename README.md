        <h1>Money cant buy happiness</h1>
        <!--hi im a comment-->
        <p> this website is for the people who need something to keep going, when they feel like they just cant anymore. The future is currently being written. the biggest illusion being created is that we dont have control over our own happiness. Never fall for that trap. if youre reading this right now youre already headed for the path of success.</p>

        <!--we can update what we want to put in the website in comments-->
        <h1> side gigs </h1>
        <p> we must give ourselves permission to want more. Dont deny your desires! Never neglect being true to ourselves while on the path towards success. the soul needs different kinds of love to grow and express itself fully. Stop believing you cant get the love you want.</p>
<!-- this isnt just a website for the divine mother like it used to be, now we cleaning the office. we are working on something greater than ourselves, theres always enough to get the love we need, have faith. never be fooled into thinking theres no way out. Make sure all our love needs are fulfilled so that we produce are greatest work of art yet-->

<h2> Interview with the ocean</h2>
<p> I was never really good at just creating because I was always scared of what the reactions would be, but the more I do it the more I realize im my biggest critic. I always used to run on pressure and now I have to pressure myself to create and its such a strange feeling that Im tryna brainwash myself into it.</p>

<h2> Interview with The Rose</h2>
<p>you always paying attetion to other girls. look at me dick. [inaudible] anyway what was the question again... o right listen its easier the more I got out of my own way. Idk what else to tell you, you just gotta push yourself out the way sometimes. and create something beautiful. SMILEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</p>

<h2> Interview with the interviewer</h2>
